VHDL Cosimulation with GHDL (VPI, VHPI)

Modifications to GHDL VPI Examples
"This was a quick experiment to take the cver VPI implementation, compile it and load it in GHDL.
The experiment was successful but was a very limited experiment. Although the VPI was loaded
successfully nothing from the VPI interface was accessed. Need to do some more experiments
to test feasibility of the VPI interface."
